Description: Installer components to load:
Extended_description: All components of the installer needed to complete the install will be loaded automatically and are not listed here. Some other (optional) installer components are shown below. They are probably not necessary, but may be interesting to some users.\n\nNote that if you select a component that requires others, those components will also be loaded.

Type: multiselect
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Description: Installer components to load:
Extended_description: To save memory, only components that are certainly needed for an install are selected by default. The other installer components are not all necessary for a basic install, but you may need some of them, especially certain kernel modules, so look through the list carefully and select the components you need.\n\nNote that if you select a component that requires others, those components will also be loaded.

Type: error
Description: Failed to load installer component
Extended_description: Loading ${PACKAGE} failed for unknown reasons. Aborting.

Name: anna/no_kernel_modules
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Continue the install without loading kernel modules?
Extended_description: No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch between the kernel used by this version of the installer and the kernel version available in the archive.\n\nIf you're installing from a mirror, you can work around this problem by choosing to install a different version of Debian. The install will probably fail to work if you continue without kernel modules.

Choices: generic: include all available drivers, targeted: only include drivers needed for this system
Description: Drivers to include in the initrd:
Extended_description: The primary function of an initrd is to allow the kernel to mount the root file system. It therefore needs to contain all drivers and supporting programs required to do that.\n\nA generic initrd is much larger than a targeted one and may even be so large that some boot loaders are unable to load it but has the advantage that it can be used to boot the target system on almost any hardware. With the smaller targeted initrd there is a very small chance that not all needed drivers are included.

Description: Key to function as AltGr:

Name: keyboard-configuration/compose
Type: select
Default: No compose key
Choices: No compose key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Logo key, Caps Lock
Description: Compose key:

Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
Extended_description: When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to Latin mode. The keyboard remains in that mode as long as the chosen key is kept pressed. That key may also be used to input national letters when the keyboard is in Latin mode.\n\nYou can disable this feature by choosing "No temporary switch".

Name: keyboard-configuration/toggle

Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
Extended_description: You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national layout and the standard Latin layout.\n\nRight Alt or Caps Lock keys are often chosen for ergonomic reasons (in the latter case, use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps toggle). Alt+Shift is also a popular combination; it will however lose its usual behavior in Emacs and other programs that use it for specific needs.\n\nNot all listed keys are present on all keyboards.

This enables you to just issue the command "boot_debian" at the CFE prompt.\n\nIf you prefer to auto-boot on every startup, you can set the following variable in addition to the ones above:\n\n setenv -p STARTUP "$boot_debian"

Description: Logical Volume Management
Extended_description: A common situation for system administrators is to find that some disk partition (usually the most important one) is short on space, while some other partition is underused. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) can help with this.\n\nLVM allows combining disk or partition devices ("physical volumes") to form a virtual disk ("volume group"), which can then be divided into virtual partitions ("logical volumes"). Volume groups and logical volumes may span several physical disks. New physical volumes may be added to a volume group at any time, and logical volumes can be resized up to the amount of unallocated space in the volume group.\n\nThe items on the LVM configuration menu can be used to edit volume groups and logical volumes. After you return to the main partition manager screen, logical volumes will be displayed in the same way as ordinary partitions, and should be treated as such.

Type: select
Default: optimal
Choices: cylinder, minimal, optimal
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
Extended_description: Adjust the policy for starting and ending alignment of new partitions.  You can generally leave this alone unless optimal alignment causes some kind of problem.\n\nCylinder alignment was required by very old DOS-era systems, and is not usually needed nowadays.  However, a few buggy BIOSes may try to calculate cylinder/head/sector addresses for partitions and get confused if partitions aren't cylinder-aligned.\n\nMinimal alignment ensures that new partitions are aligned to physical blocks on the disk, avoiding performance degradation that may occur with cylinder alignment particularly on modern disks.\n\nOptimal alignment ensures that new partitions are aligned to a suitable multiple of the physical block size, guaranteeing optimal performance.

Default: uuid
Choices: traditional, label, uuid
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
Extended_description: Normally, filesystems are mounted using a universally unique identifier (UUID) as a key; this allows them to be mounted properly even if their device name changes. UUIDs are long and difficult to read, so, if you prefer, the installer can mount filesystems based on the traditional device names, or based on a label you assign. However, note that traditional device names may change based on the order in which the kernel discovers devices at boot, which may cause the wrong filesystem to be mounted; similarly, labels are likely to clash if you plug in a new disk or a USB drive, and if that happens your system's behaviour when started will be random.\n\nIf you set "label" here, any filesystems without a label will be mounted using a UUID instead.\n\nDevices with stable names, such as LVM logical volumes, will continue to use their traditional names rather than UUIDs.

Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Create a normal user account now?
Extended_description: It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities, such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for those day-to-day tasks.\n\nNote that you may create it later (as well as any additional account) by typing 'adduser <username>' as root, where <username> is an username, like 'imurdock' or 'rms'.

Name: passwd/root-login
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Allow login as root?
Extended_description: If you choose not to allow root to log in, then a user account will be created and given the power to become root using the 'sudo' command.

Name: passwd/root-password
Type: password
Description: Root password:
Extended_description: You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries, or a word that could be easily associated with you.\n\nA good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation and should be changed at regular intervals.\n\nThe root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo" command.\n\nNote that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.
