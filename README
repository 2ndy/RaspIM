The development of the project consist  of embedding the characteristic of the WIFI router, an instant message server and a web server where clients could monitor environmental variables, in a specific device. This is known as an hybrid node, it is very useful, because it is not necessary to buy different hardware devices for a WIFI router, or for a web server, or even a server for sensing the environmental variables. Additionally, the best of this hardware device, which is called “Raspberry pi”, is that it is a low budget device as well as a powerful ARM-based PC which combines an open hardware characteristic and high compatibilities.

This prototype has three important components: the first one is the WIFI node, that will be implemented over a Raspberry pi, through a software called “Hostapd” that is allowing us to convert and put it on our USB network interface on bridge mode and work as a master access point, also through the native linux firewall “Iptables” it is possible to redirect the users traffic to a local server embedded at the Raspberry pi. The second component is a local web server, where clients can see the environmental values like temperature, humidity, among others things and finally the third component is a link to an instant message server application where the clients will be able to connect to each others and communicate among themselves.
